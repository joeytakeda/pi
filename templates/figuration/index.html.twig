    <p>Application software like Photoshop is more than just code, it is a kind of “branded skill”. In order to
        understand how application software is embedded in culture – how it is enrolled as repetition in habits of life
        and work — we have to move past an infinitive, intransitive level and abstract level of understanding of
        Photoshop as digital code. But nor is Photoshopping something that operates at an purely tacit level —
        transmitted through embodied performance — but also through its inscription as patterns of material, meaning,
        and action. Rather than examine these videos as ‘instructions’, as informational inscriptions about Photoshop
        for instrumental purposes, we should instead analyse them as figurations – as inscriptions of Photoshop that
        pattern action and render expectations for how they can and should be typically performed in certain situations
        (see Couldry &amp; Hepp (2016) for more details).</p>
    
    <p>What matters is therefore to ask:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>How is Photoshopping practiced and inscribed in these videos?</li>
        <li>What orders of worth do these practices and inscriptions create and/or sustain?</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>To answer these two questions, we have synthesized our analysis of the data collected for each of the YouTube
        video profiles into figurations. Below is a list of each of the figurations we have identified with a short
        description of each one. The names for each figuration are based on the shared “purpose” that we identified for
        each of the individual video profiles.</p>
